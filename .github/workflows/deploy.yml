# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
# 
# This workflow automatically builds and deploys the Vite application to GitHub Pages
# when changes are pushed to the main branch. It uses the modern GitHub Pages deployment
# flow with upload-pages-artifact and deploy-pages actions.
#
# Manual Configuration Required (First Time Setup):
# 1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
# 2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
# 3. Push to main branch to trigger the deployment
#
# The workflow consists of two jobs:
# - Build: Installs dependencies, builds the app, and uploads the artifact
# - Deploy: Deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages
