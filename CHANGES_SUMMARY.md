# Changes Summary - GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Overview
This fix ensures that the Prompt-Hub application can successfully deploy to GitHub Pages and load data correctly when deployed with the base path `/Prompt-Hub/`.

## Critical Bug Fix

### Issue
The application was loading prompts data using an absolute path that didn't respect Vite's configured base URL:
```typescript
fetch('/data/prompts.json')
```

This caused the application to fail when deployed to GitHub Pages because it would try to fetch from:
- `https://tera-dark.github.io/data/prompts.json` ❌ (incorrect)

Instead of:
- `https://tera-dark.github.io/Prompt-Hub/data/prompts.json` ✅ (correct)

### Solution
Updated the fetch call to use Vite's `BASE_URL` environment variable:
```typescript
fetch(`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}data/prompts.json`)
```

This ensures the correct path is used in all environments:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5173/data/prompts.json`
- **Production**: `https://tera-dark.github.io/Prompt-Hub/data/prompts.json`

## Files Changed

### Modified
1. **src/types/prompt.ts** (1 line changed)
   - Updated `loadPrompts()` function to use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
   - This is the only code change required

### Added (Documentation)
1. **GITHUB_PAGES_FIX.md**
   - Detailed explanation of the issue and fix
   - Technical details about Vite's BASE_URL handling
   - Testing recommendations

2. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md**
   - Comprehensive pre-deployment verification checklist
   - All items confirmed working
   - Manual configuration steps for GitHub Pages
   - Post-deployment testing guide

3. **CHANGES_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Quick reference for what changed and why

## Verification Completed

✅ All checks passed:
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Production build completes without errors
- Built assets use correct base path `/Prompt-Hub/`
- Data files included in build output
- Fetch call in built JavaScript uses correct path
- No other absolute paths found in codebase
- Development mode still works correctly

## Status of Original Requirements

### 1. PR Merge Status ✅
All required PRs already merged to main:
- PR #1: Init Vite project
- PR #2: Define prompts data
- PR #3: Build prompt explorer
- PR #5: Configure Pages deploy

### 2. Vite Configuration ✅
- Already correctly configured
- Base path: `/Prompt-Hub/` for production, `/` for development
- No changes needed

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow ✅
- Already correctly configured
- Triggers on push to main
- Node 20 (LTS)
- Correct permissions
- No changes needed

### 4. GitHub Pages Settings Documentation ✅
- Already documented in README.md
- Clear instructions provided
- No changes needed

### 5. Asset Path Bug Fix ✅ (NEW - FIXED)
- **This was the missing piece**
- Dynamic asset loading now respects base URL
- Application will work correctly when deployed

## Acceptance Criteria Met

All acceptance criteria from the ticket are satisfied:
- ✅ All related PRs merged to main branch
- ✅ Vite base path configured correctly
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow complete and correct
- ✅ README contains GitHub Pages setup instructions
- ✅ Push to main will trigger deployment
- ✅ Deployment will succeed (bug fixed)
- ✅ Site will be accessible at `https://tera-dark.github.io/Prompt-Hub/`

## What Was Already Working

- Vite configuration (base path)
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Build process
- HTML asset references
- Static file handling

## What Was Broken (Now Fixed)

- ❌ **Before**: Dynamic data loading using absolute path
- ✅ **After**: Dynamic data loading using Vite BASE_URL

This single line change is critical for the application to function correctly on GitHub Pages.

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Clean build test passed
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
3. ✅ Production build with NODE_ENV=production passed
4. ✅ Verified built assets use correct paths
5. ✅ Verified fetch call in JavaScript bundle uses correct path
6. ✅ Development mode still works (base path = `/`)
7. ✅ No other absolute paths found in codebase

## Next Steps

1. Merge this fix to main branch
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions)
3. Push to main will trigger automatic deployment
4. Verify deployment at: `https://tera-dark.github.io/Prompt-Hub/`

## Impact

- **User Impact**: None (only affects deployment)
- **Development Impact**: None (development mode works the same)
- **Deployment Impact**: Critical fix - enables successful GitHub Pages deployment
- **Code Changes**: Minimal (1 line)
- **Risk Level**: Very low (standard Vite pattern, thoroughly tested)

## Why This Fix Works

Vite provides `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` as a compile-time constant that gets replaced with the actual base path during build:

- In development: `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` → `/`
- In production: `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` → `/Prompt-Hub/`

This allows the same code to work correctly in both environments without any conditional logic or environment detection at runtime.
